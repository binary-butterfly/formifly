# Formifly
***React form handling as light as a butterfly***

Formifly is a library that makes Form handling and frontend input validation a breeze.  
Developed as a replacement for existing Form handling libraries, Formifly was built for performance
and ease of integration with existing REST backends.

It is currently in very early development and not actually usable yet.
